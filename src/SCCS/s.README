Notes on the Makefile:

D 4
	DO NOT USE makemake!  You must edit the given Makefile to tell it
	about the file(s) you create.  After adding or removing files
	from the Makefile (or changing your #includes), do a "make depend"
E 4
I 4
	DO NOT USE makemake!  You must edit the given Makefile to tell
	it about the file(s) you create.  Add your own file names (both 
	source and object versions) to the U_* macros at the top of the
	Makefile.
E 4

I 4
	After adding or removing files from the Makefile (or changing
	your #includes), do a "make depend" to adjust the Makefile's
	dependency entries.

E 4
To create your program:

D 4
	make
E 4
I 4
	* run 'make' in your project directory
E 4

I 5
To copy it onto a USB flash drive:

D 6
	* run 'make usbu' to use the upper front-panel USB slot
	* run 'make usbl' to use the lower front-panel USB slot
E 6
I 6
	All machines in the DSL have at least two front-panel USB slots
	located at the bottom on the front of the machine; some have a
D 8
	third slot, located next to the floppy disk drive.  To copy a
	bootable image onto a flash drive inserted in one of these slots,
	you must specify the slot position.
E 6

I 6
	On the older machines in the lab, the two USB slots are arranged
	vertically, and are referred to as the upper (usbu) and lower
	(usbl) slots.  On the newer machines, the slots are arranged
	horizontally, and are referred to as the left (usbl) and right
	(usbr) slots.  On newer machines with a third USB slot, that slot
	is the upper (usbu) USB slot.
E 8
I 8
	third slot, located next to the floppy disk drive.  Under Ubuntu,
	you can use any of these slots; insert a flash drive, and the OS
	automatically creates device entries for the drive, using the
	next available disk name in /dev (e.g., /dev/sdg).

	Because the name of the device in the filesystem varies depending
	on the number and type of disk drives in the system, special
	files named /local/devices/disk on each DSL system.  This file
	has the necessary major/minor device numbers to work with the
	plugged-in flash drive.

	To copy your bootable image to the flash drive, plug the drive
	into a USB socket, wait a few moments for Ubuntu to recognize
	it and create the device entries in /dev, and type
E 8

D 8
	* run 'make usbu' to use the upper front-panel USB slot (on any
	  system)
E 8
I 8
		make usb
E 8

D 8
	* run 'make usbl' to use the lower (on an "older" system) or the
	  left (on a "newer" system) front-panel USB slot

	* run 'make usbr' to use the right front-panel USB slot (on a
	  "newer" system)
E 8
I 8
	This will remake the usb.image file (if necessary), and will then
D 9
	copy it out to /local/devices/disk.
E 9
I 9
D 10
	copy it out to the USB drive.
E 10

	copy it out to /local/devices/disk.

To copy it onto a 3.5" floppy in the drive:

D 4
	make floppy
E 4
I 4
	* run 'make floppy' in your project directory
E 9
I 9
D 10
	Note:  the Makefile still has a "floppy" target for creating a
	bootable floppy disk image.  However, this hasn't been used for
	quite a while, and the necessary support tools to do the copying
	don't exist on the current systems.  If you want to try using the
	floppy disk as a boot device, let me know.

To boot your program:

D 5
	* be sure you have copied it to floppy disk
E 5
I 5
	* be sure you have copied it to a bootable medium
E 5
D 8
	* shut down Solaris by executing the 'uhalt' command

D 9
	* shut down Ubuntu by executing the 'uhalt' command
E 9
I 9
D 10
	* shut down Ubuntu by executing the 'uhalt' command or using the
	  standard Ubuntu "shut down" menu entry

	* shut down Ubuntu by executing the 'uhalt' command
E 10
E 9
E 8
D 5
	* insert your floppy disk in the drive
E 5
I 5
	* insert the bootable medium
E 5
	* push the reset button on the front of the machine

D 8
	DO NOT just push the reset button - Solaris must be shut down
E 8
I 8
	DO NOT just push the reset button - Ubuntu must be shut down
E 8
	correctly in order to avoid damaging the filesystems.

I 9
D 10
	The lab machines should be set up to give boot priority to
	USB devices.  If you find one that isn't, let me know ASAP.
	(Please don't try to fix it yourself.)

Compiling your program creates several files:

	prog.o	linked, object form of the system

	prog.b	binary version of the system - generated from prog.o
		by removing all the object file headers and symbol table

D 4
	prog.nl	namelist of the prog.o file - lists all the global symbols,
		their values, and the section of memory they're in (Text,
		Data, Bss)
E 4
I 4
	prog.nl	namelist of the prog.o file - lists all global symbols,
		their values, and the program section they're defined in
		(Text, Data, Bss)
E 4

I 10
	prog.na	like prog.nl, but includes local symbols as well

E 10
D 4
	prog.dis a disassembly of the prog.o file - a text version of the
		binary machine code

	prog.img the binary system image - contains the bootstrap, the
		protected mode switch code, ans the system, in this layout:

			your program	sectors 3 through n+2
			next file	n+3 through p+n+2

	You can load additional files into memory by adding the name of the
	file and the address where you want it loaded to the end of the
	BuildImage command in the Makefile.  However, because the loading
